# ROB535-LiDAR_only_objectdetection
Our ROB535 final project focus on comparing performance of three different 3D detection models on nuScenes dataset. The voxelnext is implemented based on OpenPCDet, the PointPillars and CenterPoint are implemented based on the mmdetection3D. All models evaluated on the validation set of nuScenes V1.0.
